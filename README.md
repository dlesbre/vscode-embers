# Embers dark color theme

A dark color theme for VS Code using red/orange/yellow for the interface and a
large variety of colors for syntax. This was born of my frustration at built in
themes which colored different syntax construct in the same way. I've tried to
add as colors for as many selectors as possible, with related objects (e.g.
constants and boolean) having shades of the same color.

This was mainly designed and tested with OCaml, Coq and Python.

The interface theming was originaly done with
[https://themes.vscode.one](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/dlesbre/7VgZP9N3)
and the syntax highlighting was started using
[https://tmtheme-editor.glitch.me/](https://tmtheme-editor.glitch.me/)
